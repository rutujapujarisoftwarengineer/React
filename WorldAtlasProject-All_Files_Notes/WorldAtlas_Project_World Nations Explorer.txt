React Thapa technical youtube channel github link - https://github.com/thapatechnical/thapa-react-19-website

1.NavBar - This section includes total 2 parts. One for WorldAtlas and another for Home, About, Country and Contact. All the respective codes
are available in vs code/Github.
We used react router dom concept for this. 

2.Hero Section -
This section includes total 3 parts. 
1.Parent component - This include both parts as header, para and button part. And also include image part.
2.Child component - This is header, para and button part.
3.Child component - This is image part.

File name - HeroSection.jsx
<FaLongArrowAltRight /> - This is component
import { FaLongArrowAltRight } from "react-icons/fa"; - This is import. These both are used from react icons website.

3.About page - This about page we have inserted in Home page. About page is divided in total 3 div parts. 
It contains header and div. Each div part have json data which in the file CountryData.json file under api folder under src.
Now, Under div part we have these id, countryName, capital, population, interestingFact keys which are under each country.
We used map() function from JS for country and used key as id for card. Becoz id is different for all countries. 
i.e. we created api and inserted code for card as for all countries.
And also we have to give HeroSection and About (<HeroSection /> <About />) inside Home.jsx like this.
Now we are having our home and about page is ready without footer.

4.Contact.jsx - In this we have developed on contact us form. In the code we have new concept,
formData.entries() - It returns an iterator of key-value pairs from the form data.
Each key corresponds to a form input's name and the value corresponds to the input's value.
e.g.if your form has fields like <input name = "username", value= "John" />, it will return ['username', 'john']			

Object.fromEntries(formData.entries()): 
Object.fromEntries() - It is a method that converts an iterable of key-value pairs(like the one returned by formData.entries()) into an object 
where each input field's name is a key and its value is a corresponding value.
e.g.if the form had two fields username=John and password="abcd" this method will create object: ['John', 'abcd'] 

5.Footer.jsx - In this we have code for footer section which includes Find Us, Call Us, Email Us icons. These icons used from react icons.
We created one object which is common for all the icons.And given name as icon as dynamic. Becoz we can't pass all three icons at a time. 
Hence, we passed dynamic icon which creates logos for all icons on website.

6.Footerapi.json - This is having all object like icon,title and details as key and value pairs. These pairs we use 
for footer section.

7.Country page -
Under api -> create postApi.jsx -> we are using axios for api creation. Also we can use fetch method. But, We are creating instance of the
axios using axios.create function. Under this function we have passed BaseURL.

Country.jsx - Inside this file we used useEffect() hook and made function async-await. We have to import postApi in this file and we 
have displayed data on console. Also, we have included <Loader />.

Loader.jsx - This includes loader function which is already available and displays loader.
