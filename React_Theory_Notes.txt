**** Theory React Notes - 

React is a front-end JavaScript library.
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.React is used to build single-page applications.React allows us to create reusable UI components.React is also known as React.js or ReactJS.
React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, 
where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM. React only changes what needs to be changed!

** steps -
The vite is used to create and build react project. we provide command -
1. Firstly, we have to install VS Code and nodejs.
2. npm create vite@latest on command prompt.
3. After this command, use this link http://localhost:5173/ in browser to run project.
4. Now, we have many files and folders in react project. we have 'src' folder under that 'App.jsx' is main file. we have to modify this file as
per the reuirement.
5. As per the project demand we have to create components under this 'src' folder.

1.React JSX -
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.JSX allows us to write HTML in React.JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
 
React JSX Expressions -
One of the most powerful features of JSX is the ability to embed JavaScript expressions directly within your markup.
Expressions -
You can insert any valid JavaScript expression inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces { }.
React will evaluate the expression and render the result in the DOM.
Variables -
Variables are also valid expressions. Insert variables in JSX by wrapping it in curly braces { }.
Function Calls -
Function calls are valid expressions. Insert function calls in JSX by wrapping it in curly braces { }.
Object Properties -
Access object properties within JSX.

React JSX Attributes -
JSX allows you to insert attributes into HTML elements, but there are a few important differences.

class = className -
The class attribute is a much used attribute in HTML, but since JSX is rendered as JavaScript, and the class keyword is a reserved word in JavaScript, you are not allowed to use it in JSX.
JSX solved this by using className instead. When JSX is rendered, it translates className attributes into class attributes.

Expressions as Attributes -
You can also use JavaScript expressions as attribute values. This is very useful for dynamic attributes.Note that the attribute value 
is not wrapped in quotes, this is important when using expressions (JavaScript variables) as attribute values. If you use quotes, JSX will treat it as a string literals and not a JavaScript expression.

camelCase Event Attributes -
Event attributes in JSX are written in camelCase.

Boolean Attributes -
If you pass no value for an attribute, JSX treats it as true. To pass false, you must specify it as an expression.
The style Attribute -
The style attribute in JSX only accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased CSS property names, rather than a CSS string (as in HTML).

2.Conditions - if statements -
React supports if statements, but not inside JSX.To be able to use conditional statements in JSX, you should put the if statements outside of the JSX, or you could use a ternary expression instead.

3.React Components -
Components are like functions that return HTML elements.Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.Components come in two types, Class components and Function components. 

In older React code bases,Class components primarily used.
It is now suggested to use Function components along with Hooks, instead of Class components.
Class components are still supported.
When creating a React component, the component's name MUST start with an upper case letter.React components returns HTML code.
1.Class Components -
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render function.

4.Props -
Arguments can be passed into a component as props, which stands for properties.You send the arguments into the component as HTML attributes.
We can send as many properties or props as we want.We can send props from one to other component.

Data types -
React props can be of any data type, including variables, numbers, strings, objects, arrays, and more. Strings can be sent inside quotes but numbers, variables, and objects need to be sent inside curly brackets.
Note: React Props are read-only! You will get an error if you try to change their value.

5.Events -
Just like HTML DOM events, React can perform actions based on user events.React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.
Adding Events
React events are written in camelCase syntax: onClick instead of onclick.
React event handlers are written inside curly braces: onClick={shoot}  instead of onclick="shoot()".

Passing Arguments
To pass an argument to an event handler, use an arrow function.
